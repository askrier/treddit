#### How to Use Treddit
* To make a trail
    * On the map (leftmost) tab, select "Start Hike"
    * The map will begin showing your trail being made in progress as you move around
    * Once you are satisfied with your trail, select "Stop Hike"
    * A popup will cover the screen, here you can give the trail a name, pick if you would like it to be private or not, post the trail, or discard it
    * Your trail has been made!
* To use the social feature
    * Go to the social (middle) tab
    * The search bar can be used to find keywords in trail descriptions ('run', 'city', etc) or users by username if prefaced by an '@'
    * Clicking the hollow heart icon on each trail will "like" it, clicking a filled heart will remove your "like" from that trail
    * Clikcing on the trail's profile picture will prompt a popup of that user's info. You can either go back, or view this person's trails
    * Clicking on the trails will prompt a popup to cover the screen with this trail
    * You can start, pause, and stop the playback of this trail
* To see yourself in treddit
    * Go to the profile (rightmost) tab
    * Your current profile (picture, username, description) are shown at the top
    * You can edit these attributes, as well as access your QR code by clicking the edit button in the top right corner
    * In this edit page, you can interact with the text boxes, clicking on the image will prompt you to either remove or provide a new image
    * You may also scan a previously generated, or email the current QR code
    * You may save changes by selecting the checkmark button, and discard changes by selecting the 'x' button
    * Back on the profile page, you can interact with the trails much like in the social tab
    * The key difference is that, when viewing individual trails, you can choose to edit that trail, which will prompt a popup exactly like when that trail was created
